# What’s the challenge?
For our inaugural hackathon, we’ll be exploring a topic that is close to WIQD’s heart: Data and DEI. WIQD envisions a Dutch quantum sector in which everyone feels that they belong. But to achieve this, we need to know who currently feels included and who doesn’t. Whose voices aren’t being heard? What blind spots do we have, and how can we do better? We think that data is a powerful way to explore these questions. In this hackathon, we invite you to think along with us and come up with creative ways of collecting, communicating and interpreting DEI-related data.

See the DataStarterPack document for a list of data sets that may help get you started (this is the same document you will have received in the pre-event email). We encourage you to share other data you may encounter with other participants via this repository or the Slack channel.
